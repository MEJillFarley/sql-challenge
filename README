# Unit 9 Homework: Employee Database

## Background

It’s a beautiful spring day, and it’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.
# Data Uploads
Created employee database in PgAdmin
Uploaded all CSV files  - departments, dept_emp, dept_manager, employees, salaries, titles
Reviewed available data

# ERD File (Entity-relationship model)
Utilized app.sqldbm.com to diagram the employee database (PDF attached) 
pgAdmin - Created tables establising primary and foreign keys based in where the data was coming from and linked.

# Data Analysis
SELECT data from each csv file (table file.column) to prepare the criteria below
INNER JOIN to link employee numbers, department numbers to review salaries, department allocations
WHERE to further define needed attributes - specfic names and departments
WHERE CAST to determine specific hire date/year

ORDER BY by descending count order
